The Odin Project - Ruby Chess Project

This project is part of The Odin Project Curriculum [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-final-project]

This is the final project from The Odin Project's Ruby Learning track. I created a command line chess game using what I learned about Object Oriented Programming, TDD, and data structures.

The 8x8 board is created with black and white tiles with the corresponding pieces placed at the beginning of the game. Players then take turns moving their pieces until one of them checkmates or catches the other's king. 

There are methods in place to prevent illegal moves and to alert of a check and mate.

Saving current games, and loading saved games is available at the start of the screen.
